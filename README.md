# RadReirradiation 🧬

### Radiotherapy Re-irradiation Analysis and Biological Dose Summation in 3D Slicer

**RadReirradiation** utilizes the **Linear-Quadratic (LQ)** model to perform voxel-by-voxel calculations of Biologically Effective Dose (BED) and EQD2 (Equivalent Dose in 2 Gy fractions), enabling precise evaluation of the accumulated dose in critical structures and tumor volumes (DVH).

## Features 🚀
* **Interactive Manual Pre-Alignment:** Introduced a brand-new, safe manual pre-alignment panel. Users can now translate the Moving CT using intuitive sliders before running the automatic registration.
* **Smart "Auto-Center" for CBCTs:** Added a one-click "Auto-Center CTs" button. It calculates the true RAS mathematical center of both datasets (bypassing FOV discrepancies common in Linac CBCTs) and teleports the images to match, automatically jumping all 2D slice views to the new target.
* **Image Registration Wrapper:** Automated Rigid, Affine and Deformable (B-Spline) registration workflows using the BRAINSFit engine, eliminating the need to switch between multiple Slicer modules.
* **Auto-Resampling Dose Engine:** Automatically resamples the moving dose grid to perfectly match the reference geometry, preventing matrix dimension errors during biological accumulation.
* **Smart UI Automation:** The module intelligently auto-selects the aligned volumes for the biological calculation step, reducing human error.
* **Time-Corrected Radiobiology:** Full support for standard LQ model (BED and EQD2) with temporal recovery factors for accurate reirradiation assessment.
* **Voxel-by-Voxel processing:** Operates directly on DICOM RTDOSE arrays using NumPy for high-performance biological conversion.
* **Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) support:** Automatically respects varying dose-per-fraction gradients within the same volume.
* **Time-Based Recovery Factor:** Applies partial biological recovery discounts to the base plan based on the interval between treatments.
* **"Eclipse-Style" Dose Wash:** Custom dynamic color map transition (Dark Blue to Red) with a 2 Gy threshold and 40% opacity, replicating the familiar visual experience of commercial Treatment Planning Systems (TPS).
* **Seamless SlicerRT Integration:** Output volumes are directly compatible with SlicerRT's Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) module.
* **Dosimetric Analysis:** Metrics table (Dmax, Dmean) synchronized with structure visibility.
*  **DVH Generation:** Generation of interactive DVH curves within the Slicer.

## Step-by-step tutorial 🛠️

**1. Data Preparation: From TPS to 3D Slicer**

To perform an accurate re-irradiation analysis, you must export two complete datasets from your Treatment Planning System (TPS): the Previous (1) Treatment and the Current/Planned Treatment (2).

<img width="679" height="266" alt="0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4493ec9f-dac8-485c-b845-ac161f34d67d" />

Export Requirements (from your TPS):
* CT Images (CT)
* RT Doses (RD)
* RT Structure Sets (RS)
* Optional but recommended: RT Plans (RP)

Succesfull exportation of the previous treatmet, repeat the same steps for the current/planned treatmet

<img width="1187" height="577" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5abe9de0-c1a2-48b4-91ba-bd2f509485d8" />

**Importing into 3D Slicer:**

Ensure you have the SlicerRT extension installed. It is a mandatory requirement to read and process Radiotherapy DICOM files. Drag and drop your exported DICOM folders into the 3D Slicer application or use the native DICOM Browser and click on Examine button.

<img width="1202" height="772" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8e57085-13bf-4b7d-af89-d7e2dae9fa4e" />
<img width="1916" height="995" alt="4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79303f7a-ca0d-4811-878f-30696658eed1" />
Once the DICOM files are loaded only check the TAC, RD and RS of the previous and current treatmets, click on Load button. RP is optional; it is not used in this version but will be used in future developments.  
<img width="1380" height="245" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d384dfb-b3c6-46e5-8363-484765c64c5d" />
Crucial Steps: When the DICOM import window appears, ensure the "eye" icon next to your RT Structures is toggled ON (visible). If this icon is closed, the structures will not be loaded into the scene and the DVH cannot be evaluated.

Data Organization Tip:
Since TPS exports often generate generic names (In this example, the RTDOSE files in both treatmets have the same name), it is highly recommended to rename your loaded volumes immediately (e.g., rename them to CT_Previous, CT_Current, Dose_Previous, Dose_Current). This will prevent confusion when assigning volumes in the RadReirradiation module.

**2. Loading Data and Smart Alignment**

Once your DICOM data is properly imported and organized in 3D Slicer, it is time to load it into the extension to coregister the previous treatment with the current patient anatomy.

Launching the Module:

* Open the module dropdown menu (usually displaying "Welcome to Slicer").
* Navigate to Radiotherapy and select RadReirradiation.

<img width="1170" height="981" alt="8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06ce3f6-5496-48ed-8806-f3d7d5e557d9" />


**RadReirradiation**  has 4 important modules, which are:

1. Data selection and image registration with Dose resample.
2. Structures visualization (important for the DVH analysis).
3. Reirradiation calculation settings.
4. Metrics an DVH results.

**Assigning Volumes:**

In the Data Selection panel, carefully assign your loaded volumes to their corresponding roles:
* Moving CT / Previous CT: The historical anatomy that needs to be registered.
* RTDOSE Previous treatment.
* Fixed CT / Current /planned CT: The anatomy where the final dose summation will be evaluated.
* RTDOSE Current/planned Treatment.

<img width="523" height="249" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bc186c4-953e-4961-8806-9d16133841b0" />

**Pre-Alignment and Image Registration with Dose resample:**

Before computing any biological dose, both CTs must be spatially aligned. Click the "Auto-Center CTs" button. This will automatically match the mathematical centers of both image sets, providing an excellent starting point.
At this point, it is recommended to hide the structures to better visualize the Pre-Aligment and image Registration results. To do this, use module 2 (Structures visualization), select the RS CURRENT file, and press the "Hide all structures" button.

<img width="1920" height="1007" alt="11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1a32f96-e860-47de-9c8b-e2b062f028e5" />

Use the manual sliders to fine-tune the alignment if the patient setups were significantly different, this will be the starting point for the image registration and Dose resample algorithm.

<img width="1770" height="890" alt="12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d36b17ae-6067-4cf9-8669-29d6164cf2a7" />

 **Registration Options & Processing Time:**

 Press the button Auto-Registration and Dose resample, this uses the built-in BRAINSFit integration to lock the previous CT and its dose onto the current anatomy. the module includes two checkeable options for improve image registration results:
 
* Affine Registration: Performs a linear transformation (translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing).
* Deformable Registration: Performs a non-linear transformation (BSpline) that adapts to anatomical changes between the two scans, such as weight loss or tumor shrinkage.
* ⚠️ Warning: Please note that checking those options, especially the Deformable option, is computationally intensive. It may take several minutes to complete depending on your computer's hardware specifications.

**Visualizing the Fusion Results:**

After the registration is complete, it is highly recommended to perform a visual Quality Assurance (QA). Use Slicer's native foreground/background fade sliders (located at the top of the 2D slice views) to blend the Previous CT and Current CT. This visual check ensures the accuracy of the alignment before proceeding to the dose calculation.

<img width="1846" height="889" alt="13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15ca65fe-f9af-4316-ae5f-793881cdfea1" />

**3. Reirradiation Caulculation settings and DVH Evaluation**

With the CT images already registered, the extension streamlines your workflow. Thanks to the image registration algorithm, the newly registered and mapped to the current anatomy: Previous RT Dose (RD PREVIOUS_Registered) is automatically loaded in the module, saving you manual steps and reducing setup errors.

<img width="522" height="260" alt="14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14cf11d0-463d-4570-bf56-0927a8b9b411" />

**Reirradiation Settngs:**

* Adjust the Alpha/Beta (α/β) ratios according to the specific tissue or tumor being evaluated.
     * ⚠️ Important Clinical Note: Currently, the module performs the biological summation using a single global alpha/beta ratio per calculation. If you want to evaluate late effects on Organs at Risk (OARs), set the ratio to e.g. 3 and calculate. To evaluate tumor control, you will need to change the ratio to e.g. 10 and run a new calculation, is not necessary to perform the image registration and all the previous steps, just change the alpha/beta and click the Calculate button. (Note: A future update is currently in development to allow structure-specific alpha/beta assignments).
* Enter the number of fractions for the previous and current treatment.
* Time-Discount Factor (Partial Recovery): If you consider it necessary to apply a dose discount factor, you can enable the "Time Discount" option. This feature accounts for the partial biological recovery of healthy tissues over time. Based on the selected elapsed time, the module applies a specific dose reduction factor to the previous treatment before the final summation: (Note: These factors are based on Nieder C, Grosu AL, Andratschke NH, Molls M. Update of human spinal cord reirradiation tolerance based on additional data from 38 patients [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17084560/] and provide a more realistic biological estimation).

     * 0 to 6 months: No recovery assumed. 0% discount is applied (100% of the previous dose is considered).
     * 6 to 12 months: Partial recovery assumed. A 25%  discount factor is applied. (75 % of the previous dose is considered).
     * 12 to 24 months: Advanced recovery assumed. A 50% discount factor is applied. (50 % of the previous dose is considered).
     * 24 to X months: Prolonged recovery assumed. A 65 % discount factor is applied. (35 % of the previous dose is considered).
     
* Click the "Calculate Cumulative EQD2 Dose" button.

<img width="522" height="260" alt="15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f5e7027-0e84-4a60-a4e1-c1b0cff8c820" />

**4 Visualizing the Results:**

Once the calculation is complete, the extension generates a new biologically equivalent dose volume (EQD2).  Eclipse-Style Dose Wash: Slicer will automatically apply a dynamic color heatmap (with a Scalar Bar) to the generated dose.
<img width="1902" height="886" alt="16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74ab0f5a-f78b-4986-93f9-e0b3b2560bb5" />

Structure Visualization (The "Eye" Icon): To actually see your contours overlaid on the CT and the dose wash, navigate to the RadReirradiation module 2 (Structure visualization). use the current Structure Set (e.g. RS CURRENT) , expand the list, and toggle the "eye" icon next to each specific structure (e.g., Spinal Cord, Brainstem, PTV) you wish to display in the 2D and 3D views.

<img width="1901" height="884" alt="17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07cec322-7b62-4406-b703-9c8fc56ab1db" />




DVH Analytics: To get quantitative metrics, switch to the native SlicerRT Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) module. Select your new EQD2 volume and your RT Structure Set to visualize the accumulated dose limits and ensure clinical safety constraints are met.
