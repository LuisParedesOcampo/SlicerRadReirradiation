# RadReirradiation 🧬

### Radiotherapy Re-irradiation Analysis and Biological Dose Summation in 3D Slicer

**RadReirradiation** utilizes the **Linear-Quadratic (LQ)** model to perform voxel-by-voxel calculations of Biologically Effective Dose (BED) and EQD2 (Equivalent Dose in 2 Gy fractions), enabling precise evaluation of the accumulated dose in critical structures and tumor volumes (DVH).

## Features 🚀
* **Interactive Manual Pre-Alignment:** Introduced a brand-new, safe manual pre-alignment panel. Users can now translate the Moving CT using intuitive sliders before running the automatic registration.
* **Smart "Auto-Center" for CBCTs:** Added a one-click "Auto-Center CTs" button. It calculates the true RAS mathematical center of both datasets (bypassing FOV discrepancies common in Linac CBCTs) and teleports the images to match, automatically jumping all 2D slice views to the new target.
* **Image Registration Wrapper:** Automated Rigid, Affine and Deformable (B-Spline) registration workflows using the BRAINSFit engine, eliminating the need to switch between multiple Slicer modules.
* **Auto-Resampling Dose Engine:** Automatically resamples the moving dose grid to perfectly match the reference geometry, preventing matrix dimension errors during biological accumulation.
* **Smart UI Automation:** The module intelligently auto-selects the aligned volumes for the biological calculation step, reducing human error.
* **Time-Corrected Radiobiology:** Full support for standard LQ model (BED and EQD2) with temporal recovery factors for accurate reirradiation assessment.
* **Voxel-by-Voxel processing:** Operates directly on DICOM RTDOSE arrays using NumPy for high-performance biological conversion.
* **Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) support:** Automatically respects varying dose-per-fraction gradients within the same volume.
* **Time-Based Recovery Factor:** Applies partial biological recovery discounts to the base plan based on the interval between treatments.
* **"Eclipse-Style" Dose Wash:** Custom dynamic color map transition (Dark Blue to Red) with a 2 Gy threshold and 40% opacity, replicating the familiar visual experience of commercial Treatment Planning Systems (TPS).
* **Seamless SlicerRT Integration:** Output volumes are directly compatible with SlicerRT's Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) module.
* **Dosimetric Analysis:** Metrics table (Dmax, Dmean) synchronized with structure visibility.
*  **DVH Generation:** Generation of interactive DVH curves within the Slicer.
