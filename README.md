# RadReirradiation 🧬

### Radiotherapy Re-irradiation Analysis and Biological Dose Summation in 3D Slicer

**RadReirradiation** utilizes the **Linear-Quadratic (LQ)** model to perform voxel-by-voxel calculations of Biologically Effective Dose (BED) and EQD2 (Equivalent Dose in 2 Gy fractions), enabling precise evaluation of the accumulated dose in critical structures and tumor volumes (DVH).

## Features 🚀
* **Interactive Manual Pre-Alignment:** Introduced a brand-new, safe manual pre-alignment panel. Users can now translate the Moving CT using intuitive sliders before running the automatic registration.
* **Smart "Auto-Center" for CBCTs:** Added a one-click "Auto-Center CTs" button. It calculates the true RAS mathematical center of both datasets (bypassing FOV discrepancies common in Linac CBCTs) and teleports the images to match, automatically jumping all 2D slice views to the new target.
* **Image Registration Wrapper:** Automated Rigid, Affine and Deformable (B-Spline) registration workflows using the BRAINSFit engine, eliminating the need to switch between multiple Slicer modules.
* **Auto-Resampling Dose Engine:** Automatically resamples the moving dose grid to perfectly match the reference geometry, preventing matrix dimension errors during biological accumulation.
* **Smart UI Automation:** The module intelligently auto-selects the aligned volumes for the biological calculation step, reducing human error.
* **Time-Corrected Radiobiology:** Full support for standard LQ model (BED and EQD2) with temporal recovery factors for accurate reirradiation assessment.
* **Voxel-by-Voxel processing:** Operates directly on DICOM RTDOSE arrays using NumPy for high-performance biological conversion.
* **Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) support:** Automatically respects varying dose-per-fraction gradients within the same volume.
* **Time-Based Recovery Factor:** Applies partial biological recovery discounts to the base plan based on the interval between treatments.
* **"Eclipse-Style" Dose Wash:** Custom dynamic color map transition (Dark Blue to Red) with a 2 Gy threshold and 40% opacity, replicating the familiar visual experience of commercial Treatment Planning Systems (TPS).
* **Seamless SlicerRT Integration:** Output volumes are directly compatible with SlicerRT's Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) module.
* **Dosimetric Analysis:** Metrics table (Dmax, Dmean) synchronized with structure visibility.
*  **DVH Generation:** Generation of interactive DVH curves within the Slicer.

## Step-by-step tutorial 🛠️

**1. Data Preparation: From TPS to 3D Slicer**

To perform an accurate re-irradiation analysis, you must export two complete datasets from your Treatment Planning System (TPS): the Previous (1) Treatment and the Current/Planned Treatment (2).

Export Requirements (from your TPS):
* CT Images (CT)
* RT Doses (RD)
* RT Structure Sets (RS)
* Optional but recommended: RT Plans (RP)

Succesfull exportation of the previous treatmet, repeat the same steps for the current/planned treatmet

**Importing into 3D Slicer:**

Ensure you have the SlicerRT extension installed. It is a mandatory requirement to read and process Radiotherapy DICOM files. Drag and drop your exported DICOM folders into the 3D Slicer application or use the native DICOM Browser and click on Examine button.

Once the DICOM files are loaded only check the TAC, RD and RS of the previous and current treatmets, click on Load button. RP is optional; it is not used in this version but will be used in future developments.  
<img width="1380" height="245" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d384dfb-b3c6-46e5-8363-484765c64c5d" />
Crucial Steps: When the DICOM import window appears, ensure the "eye" icon next to your RT Structures is toggled ON (visible). If this icon is closed, the structures will not be loaded into the scene and the DVH cannot be evaluated.

Data Organization Tip:
Since TPS exports often generate generic names (In this example, the RTDOSE files in both treatmets have the same name), it is highly recommended to rename your loaded volumes immediately (e.g., rename them to CT_Previous, CT_Current, Dose_Previous, Dose_Current). This will prevent confusion when assigning volumes in the RadReirradiation module.

**2. Loading Data and Smart Alignment**

Once your DICOM data is properly imported and organized in 3D Slicer, it is time to load it into the extension to coregister the previous treatment with the current patient anatomy.

Launching the Module:

* Open the module dropdown menu (usually displaying "Welcome to Slicer").
* Navigate to Radiotherapy and select RadReirradiation.

**Assigning Volumes:**

In the Data Selection panel, carefully assign your loaded volumes to their corresponding roles:
* Moving CT / Previous CT: The historical anatomy that needs to be registered.
* Reference CT / Current CT: The anatomy where the final dose summation will be evaluated.

Do the same for the RT Dose volumes.
